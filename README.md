# Course-Connect
Course Connect designed by Jacob Barats and Alex Movsesyan was pitch for a social media platform that would connect students in same classes to chat with each other. The idea for the platform was birthed from the lack of communication with class mates during the height of the Covid-19 Pandemic. While there were class communication channels such as GroupMe and Canvas, none of these normalized one on one conversation with peers.

Being our Sophomore year of college, desiging the framework for Course Connect was no minute task. Alex and I tackled learning front end web design and Amazon cloud hosting, two large skill sets that neither of us had ever engaged with before. Through the life span of the project we determined our own deadlines and had to work under the pressure of completing the project before the end of winter break.

While ultimatly the final form of the project did not come to fruition due to rival apps and the in-person classes resuming, the process of building the app was a great learning experience for the both of us. We both learned that in a short period of time we were able to self motivate ourselves to quickly assess and tackle a large project.
